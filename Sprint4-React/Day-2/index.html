     <!--what is react-->
     <!--what does the react actually acheives?
        1)reduces the usage of cost for DOM operations as ,DOM operations are costly
        2)it tries to built using a SPA(single page application) architecture
        SPA? we do not to reupload another html when navigating 
        document=> DOM operations,is actually given by the environment of JS
        document API,is the 3rd least used API in JS 
        3)React on other hand,uses a history API,inorder to modify things-->

        <!--create-react-app,vite etc-->
        <!-- CDN=> content delivery network-->
        <!--React(Algorithm that modifies UI),React-DOM(is support for React algorithm)-->
        <!--React focuses on creating the SPA's-->
        <!--whole application lives inside below div-->
        
        <div id="root"></div>

        <script type="text/babel">
            function Hello(){
                let name="react";
                //return <h1>Welcome to {name}</h1>
                return `<h1>Welcome to ${name}</h1>`;//JS code
            }
            ReactDOM.render(<Hello></Hello>,document.getElementById('root'));
        </script>
</body>

<!--
1)Components in React :-These are independent,reusable pieces of code,they 
serve the same purpose of JS functions,but work in isolation and return HTML.
2)Browser Actually understands only HTML,CSS and JS.
3)JSX:-JSX is a syntax extension to JS,used with React to describe what the UI should look like
JS+XML=>Browser need a converter to convert JSX to JS.
for that we use Babel.
4)Babel:-It is a JS compiler that converts the JSX code into JS code that browsers can understand.
5)JSX is inspired from the template literals of JS(backticks) to write HTML inside JS.
