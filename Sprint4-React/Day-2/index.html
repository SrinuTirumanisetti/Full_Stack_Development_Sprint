     <!--what is react-->
     <!--what does the react actually acheives?
        1)reduces the usage of cost for DOM operations as ,DOM operations are costly
        2)it tries to built using a SPA(single page application) architecture
        SPA? we do not to reupload another html when navigating 
        document=> DOM operations,is actually given by the environment of JS
        document API,is the 3rd least used API in JS 
        3)React on other hand,uses a history API,inorder to modify things-->

        <!--create-react-app,vite etc-->
        <!-- CDN=> content delivery network-->
        <!--React(Algorithm that modifies UI),React-DOM(is support for React algorithm)-->
        <!--React focuses on creating the SPA's-->
        <!--whole application lives inside below div-->
        
        <div id="root"></div>

        <script type="text/babel">
            function Hello(props){
                let {name}=props;//At this line Destructuring is done
                //let {name,day}={name:"React",day:2}
                //name="React",day=2
                return <h1>Welcome to the 2nd day of sprint in {name}</h1>
                //return `<h1>Welcome to ${name}</h1>`;//JS code
            }
            function HelloParent(){
                return <div>
                    <Hello name={"React"}></Hello>
                    <Hello name={"JavaScript"}></Hello>
                    <Hello name={"HTML"}></Hello>
                    </div>
            }
            ReactDOM.render(<HelloParent></HelloParent>,document.getElementById('root'));
            /*
            let object={
            name:"React",
            day:2}
            */

<!--
1)Components in React :-These are independent,reusable pieces of code,they 
serve the same purpose of JS functions,but work in isolation and return HTML.
2)Browser Actually understands only HTML,CSS and JS.
3)JSX:-JSX is a syntax extension to JS,used with React to describe what the UI should look like
JS+XML=>Browser need a converter to convert JSX to JS.
for that we use Babel.
4)Babel:-It is a JS compiler that converts the JSX code into JS code that browsers can understand.
5)JSX is inspired from the template literals of JS(backticks) to write HTML inside JS.
6)props:-Props are inputs to React components.
for every given component,props are kind of parameters or attributes that are used to pass data.
7)when we send properties/attributes with values to any given component,,the 
compenent in react receive all of them in object format.why?
as to gather all of attributes for component react follows JSON notation.
8)In react we are trying to break a large component into smaller components.
and rendering them using one single parent component.
where larger componennt,has multiple smaller components inside it.
but chunk itself is returning HTML code and we have these smaller components a lot inside it.
